# tts_netflow_a
Multi-commodity network flow Tidy, Tested, Safe demonstration repository. 
We demonstrate the Agile development process with three releases that advance functionality or fix bugs.
  1. [0.0.1](https://github.com/ticdat/tts_netflow_a/releases/tag/0.0.1) release solves a simple min cost 
  network flow problem. There is no commodities table input table because this version of the problem only 
  models a single commodity.
  1. [0.0.2](https://github.com/ticdat/tts_netflow_a/releases/tag/0.0.2) release upgrades to be a true 
  multi-commodity network flow problem.  
  1. [0.0.3](https://github.com/ticdat/tts_netflow_a/releases/tag/0.0.3) is a bug-fix release.
